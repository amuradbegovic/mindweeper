These assets have been taken from [dsdmine](https://github.com/DragonSWDev/dsdmine), an MIT-licensed clone of Windows Minesweeper. It's a very similar project to mine, albeit written in C++ (even uses `.ini` config files!)

They were converted from PNG to BMP and adapted (individual sprites rearranged) for compatibility with my own clone of the game.
