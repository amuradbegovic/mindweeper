# Mindweeper 

Mindweeper is an open source clone of the famous Windows Minesweeper game. It even supports the original game's icons/assets, providing a basically pixel-perfect, cross-platform classic minesweeper experience to players. WIP.

Note: it's called Mindweeper because the game can make you lose your mind and start weeping. Totally not beacuse it sounds similar to the original without infringing Microsoft's copyright.
